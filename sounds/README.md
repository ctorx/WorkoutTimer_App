# Sound Files for Workout Timer

This directory should contain two sound files:
1. `warning.mp3` - A gentle alert sound for the 5-second warning
2. `complete.mp3` - A more distinct sound for when the timer reaches zero

You can use any appropriate sound files, just make sure they are:
- Short (1-2 seconds)
- Clear and distinct from each other
- Not too jarring
- In MP3 format
- Named exactly as specified above
